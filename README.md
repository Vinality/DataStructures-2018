## Data Structures I
---
### Main Topics:
* Abstract Data Types 
* Linked Lists
* Queues and Stacks
* Double Ended Queues 
* Circular Arrays and Dynamic Linking
* Binary Heap
* Priority Queue using Heap
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree
* Black-Red Tree

### Project:
The project consited on building a auto correcting program where the input file would be checked against a dictionary file, stored in an AVL Tree, and then the user should selected amongst the suggested corrections to be made to the original file.

## Data Structures II
---
### Main Topics:
* Indexing Techniques
* B-Tree
* Hash Tables and Hash Functions
* Data Compression and Huffman Tree

### Projects:
1. Program to store product data implemented using an index file (simulated through a string) and index arrays on RAM.
2. The same theme but this time implemented using a B-Tree to store the primary and secondary indices.
3. Again the same theme but indexing using a hash table with a pre-made hash function.
